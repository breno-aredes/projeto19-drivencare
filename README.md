## Project Scope

<br>

The objective of this project is to develop a medical appointment scheduling platform that allows patients to schedule appointments with doctors from different specialties, choosing the available date and time for each doctor. Doctors will be able to view scheduled appointments and confirm or cancel each one. The platform will also allow patients and doctors to view a history of scheduled and completed appointments.
